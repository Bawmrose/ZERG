Our Project Idea: Accessible healthcare-focused Healthy Recipe Sharing platform (yet to be named) platform dedicated to promoting healthy eating habits and empowering students to take control of their health journey and seek community support for any struggle with eating disorders. 

Our Vision:
Living far from home as students, most of us and the university students all around the world can all agree that one thing we miss most about home is the food made with love and by our loved ones. And when gathered, we can agree that food speaks a mutual language despite the different cultures. But living in dormitories or student housing spaces, we often forget that healthy food that we used to eat at home has been the foundation of our good health and sound mind. But since it is not easily accessible and we are always running against time as students, we neglect our food habits and start to develop unhealthy lifestyles. Which most of the time can result into eating disorders and severe health damage.
Our project hopes to bring a solution for that and to create community with curious health-conscious individuals, particularly students and young professionals. We aim to build a safe, and informative Healthy Recipe Sharing platform (yet to be named) that will help them to seek a healthier approach to cooking and eating. We also offer a transformative space for sharing homecooked recipes, calorie counts, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions so that anyone reading them can find easy solutions to their everyday meal plans. 
What sets us apart is our idea of integrating health tracking features, nutrition analysis tools, and a safe platform for the users. Each user can monitor their nutrition intake by comparing their recipes with others. Create and pin their own favorite recipes posted by others. In extension, with respect to the deadlines, we hope to add personalized features for the users to adjust their health goals according to their preferences and health needs. We also hope to provide a section dedicated accessing to resources and support for those struggling with disordered eating habits or mental health issues related to food, building a supportive environment for improving overall health and wellness. With this, our project will be an accessible healthcare-focused platform dedicated to promoting healthy eating habits and empowering students to take control of their health journey no matter where they are.
